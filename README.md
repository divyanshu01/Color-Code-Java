# Color-Code-Java

### RGB Color code (0-255) ###

The following code is about getting RGB color code of any color. Simply slide the slider to maintain the proportion
of Red, Green and Blue to create a color of choice which is also displayed. Each slide bar will have its own textbox which will
be giving you the code for Red, Green and Blue.

This color code can be used in HTML and in java to make `Color()` class objects. 

**Warning**:The cross button of the frame/window is not working, work is in progress.
